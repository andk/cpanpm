2006-10-21  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_56

	* add the ability to patch random distros into the distroprefs system
	both with local patches and with patches from CPAN.

	* release 1.88_55

	* new command 'report' as requested by Schwern in #22118.

	* extend the Distribution object to local directories. Gives a meaning
	to the 'cpan .' command. Suggested by Slaven Rezic.

	* removes the linux centric behaviour of t/30shell.t.

	* do not complain THAT often about uninstalled YAML or YAML::Syck; once
	is per distro enough.

2006-10-13  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_54

	* New option 'yaml_module' to switch between YAML.pm and YAML::Syck
	Try 'o conf init /yaml/' to use it.

	* New distroprefs system that lets the user store arguments, environment
	variables, individual answers to questions asked by Distributions when
	being built, and config overrides. Try 'o conf init /prefs/' for more
	information.

	* address #21144 major documentation bug: $obj->install is NOT the same
	as CPAN::Shell->install($obj) as soon as a queue of dependencies comes
	into play.

	* fix "o conf defaults" which was broken in 1.88_53.

	* protect us against Module::Build errors with an eval around the
	requires() and build_requires() calls.

2006-10-09  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88_53

	* wrapping Module::Build calls into an eval to catch external errors
	with the right consequences.

	* 'reload cpan' now based on timestamps and always jumps into a fresh
	shell when needed.

	* display the version during loading of our own modules.

	* address #21692: make the "isa perl" case less noisy (Gabor Szabo)

	* release 1.88_51

	* dependencies declared as 'build_requires' are now treated according to
	a new policy option: try 'o conf init build_requires_install_policy' for
	more info. (Suggested/Requested by Johan Vromans)

	* fixed a bug where successful tests were repeated if things were not
	being installed like during the 'test' command itself.

	* address #21724: document that the 'r' command takes arguments; support
	the same arguments for the 'upgrade' command (Adam Kennedy)

	* address #21716: fix the broken 'recent' command (Phil Pennock)

	* fixed a rare but extremely unpleasant bug with deep recursion in
	AUTOLOAD during the 'reload cpan' command.

2006-09-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.8801

	* trivial bugfix: init dialog had a tweak that made it impossible to set
	'ncftp' when 'ncftpget' was installed and configured.

2006-09-21  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.88

	* For detailed changes since 1.87 see the entries in the Changes file.
	For finer grained change log see the ChangeLog.svn file. The highlights
	of this release are:

	* convenient configuration: dialogs for individual items or groups of
	items can be accessed with a single command (Courtesy Jim Cromie)

	* experimental support for CPAN::Reporter: try
	    o conf init /test/
	(Courtesy David Golden)

	* make installation of scripts easier: try something like
	    install	SREZIC/pingomatic-1.012
	(Courtesy Slaven Rezic)

	* colored output for better separation of process output, messages from
	CPAN and warnings from CPAN: to turn colorization on/off try
	    o conf init /color/

	* formatting of lists of modules now features a column to indicate
	installed and updateable modules

	* signature checking can now be turned on and off with 'o conf check_sigs'

	* new command 'upgrade' installs newest version of all installed modules

	* Please note a minor incompatibility: the init dialog now has reversed
	semantics: it suggests automatic configuration that can be confirmed
	with 'yes' instead of suggesting manual configuration that can be denied
	with 'no'.

2006-09-18  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_65

	* Hunting missing documentation with Test::Pod::Coverage because my
	first try to use it started with a wrong copy&paste.

	* Forward compatibility: bzip2 via Archive::Tar not dying anymore

2006-09-16  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_64

	* added test for the urllist dialog

	* added License to all pm files and to the Makefile.PL

	* allow ranges in urllist dialog, as inspired by Andrew Strebkov

	* allow "o conf init WORD WORD2..."

	* address #21484: disable inactivity_timeout when d_alarm is not "define"

	* regex in "o conf init MATCH" must now be enclosed in slashes as in all
	other commands that allow regexes

	* again tested with 5.8.0, this time with an UTF8 locale and it did
	indeed not pass the 30test: turning LANG=C now for the 30shell test,
	unconditionally

	* all supported config variables now documented in the POD and added a
	test to monitor changes in the future

2006-09-13  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_63

2006-09-11  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_62

	* make term_ornaments switchable while running (was only checked during
	initialization)

	* verify that color settings are applicable (bad colors were killing the
	shell process completely)

	* improve wording and logic when user is offline and tries to run
	the urllist dialog. (Address debian bug #380551)

2006-09-10  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_61

	* configuation of urllist uses a local urllist instead of the global
	configured one: prevents that ^C accidentally kills the currently
	configured urllist

	* configuration of urllist: if there is already a previous pick, one can
	go through the dialog with RETURN only

	* new options to get colored output: colorize_output, colorize_print,
	colorize_warn

2006-09-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_59: "o conf init MATCH" finally works and can be used to
	jump into the configuration dialog and select an arbitrary subset of
	questions.

	* perl -I. -MCPAN ... now works because we replaced C<no lib .> with
	rel2absing the INC (suggested by Slaven Rezic)

2006-08-31  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_58: work is still in progress to get "o conf init MATCH"
	working (finishing the epochal Jim Cromie patches) but all tests pass

	* initial configuration dialogue now has reversed meaning: automatic
	configuration can be confirmed with 'yes' instead of having to deny
	manual configuration with 'no'

	* fix a bug reported by David Golden, that Bundle::CPAN is never
	uptodate. Fixing it by special-casing readline.pm in the inst_file
	method. See also #17963.

	* Address #18196 once again because people have still MakeMaker < 6.18
	installed.

	* release 1.87_54

	* fix #18165: new config option term_ornaments

	"disabled program"

2006-07-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_53

	* make *scripts* (as opposed to modules) installable when the path of
	the distro is given: you can now 'install ANDK/keepcool-0.344' and it is
	stored as 'keepcool'

	* the m command displays one column more: an equals sign if we have this
	version installed, a less-than sign if our installed version of the
	module is smaller and a space if we do not have this thing installed

	* fix #18438: weird dependency chain issue that broke
	amavis/SpamAssassin

	* release 1.87_51

	* patch by Max Maischein to quote commands that contain spaces as is
	often the case on Windows systems (addresses #17877)

	* do not display DSLIP_STATUS when it is empty; same thing for MANPAGE

	* add a security advice to the manpage

	* do not advertise Bundle::CPAN when a new CPAN is available, CPAN alone
	should do

2006-02-27  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87

	* new method dslip_status for Module objects

	* make Tarzip work better on uncompressed files; fixes test failure of

	passes all tests on a bare 5.8.8 for me when CPAN_RUN_SHELL_TEST is set

2006-02-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.86_52

	* simplification of the concepts of home and of the CPAN/MyConfig.pm and
	the CPAN/Config.pm. There were too many places that tried to do the same
	thing. Should now be centralized and consistent.

2006-02-21  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.86_51

	* replace the concept of $ENV{HOME} with File::HomeDir (fixes #17759;
	Adam Kennedy)

	* remove a spurious CARRIAGE RETURN in the Todo file: it broke
	Module::Signature on Windows (fixes #17746; Adam Kennedy)

	* return empty string instead of undef when HAVE_MAKE is false (fixes
	#17768; Adam Kennedy)

	* do not try to use $CPAN::Frontend before it exists (fixes #17770; Adam
	Kennedy)

	* t/12cpan.t now behaves on 5.004 and 5.005
	
	* t/30shell.t now can be run without Expect; needs to be enabled with
	environment variable CPAN_RUN_SHELL_TEST in this case

	* more testing in 30shell.t

2006-02-20  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.86

	* quick fix for a bug in the Checksums checking code: if the cache had
	an old copy, it was in some cases not updated and if the file-to-check
	was newer, a false alarm was triggered.

	* I expect a 1.87 soonish, because we have open bugs: test 12cpan.t not
	suited for old perls; test for the above bug missing.

2006-02-19  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.85

	* Fix for 'install Bundle:CPAN' on Windows machines (closes #17699; Adam
	Kennedy)

	* Make a separate distro for Bundle::CPAN (works around the bug for
	older versions of CPAN)

	* Another fix for bundles: in some cases CPAN.pm installed an older
	bundle than the most recent

	* more tests: CPAN.pm subroutine coverage now at 71.4%

2006-02-15  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* highlights of the changes between 1.83 and 1.84: better error handling
	with new "failed" command and in many other places; new config variable
	ftp_passive is on by default; new command mkmyconfig; Module::Build
	support should now work on Windows and work better on all platforms; new
	methods for programmers CPAN::Module::distribution and
	CPAN::Distribution::author; improved docs; prettier output; and last not
	least a heavy dose of refactoring, bugfixing, and testing

	* Thanks to the bunch of helpful contributors and bug reporters (you
	know who you are:)

	* uptodate message more descriptive (Adam Kennedy; rt.cpan.rg
	#15580)

2005-12-17  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.80_56 is a release candidate for 1.81

	* integrate release 1.5 of brian's cpan script from
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/brian-d-foy/

	* Support for Module::Build: to set the preference for
	Module::Build over MakeMaker, run

	  o conf prefer_installer MB
	  o conf commit

	* ls command supports globbing; these work nicely:

	  ls KWILLIAMS/P*
	  ls JV/make*

	this works too but is slow:

	  ls */*make*

	* META.yml data replace the Makefile parsing code if YAML
	available (compensating for the frequent wrong usage of the
	requires element)

	* support SHA256; stop using MD5

	* support bzip2 compression; can be tested with 'install
	ARTURAZ/Net-Vypress-Chat-0.72.1.tar.bz2'; the CPAN indexer does
	not yet index bz2 distros but will probably start to do so as soon
	as CPANPLUS supports bzip2

	* tiny tweaks to make CPAN.pm run on a busybox (Guillaume Filion)

	* bugfix: major speedup on all commands that need expansion of
	regular expressions to module names
	
	* prettier r command output: the 4th column of the 'r' command
	drops the redundant X/XX/ prefix

	* tolerant when you type one colon instead of two on module names

	* this is release 1.80

	* support for Module::Signature courtesy Autrijus Tang

	* separated out new module CPAN::Version that has muchly improved
	support for multidot version notation that should make the
	deployment of version.pm easy for everybody. During the last weeks
	the indexer on PAUSE also got improved version.pm support and
	spits out numified versions. This release is optimized for the new
	version handling, regardless if used with or without version.pm
	(Thanks to John Peacock and to Graham Barr for their help)

	* new pragma 'notest' courtesy Slaven Rezic

	* support for sudo in the config variable

	* new feature 'show_upload_date': if set to true, all 'm' and 'd'
	commands will display the upload date

	* fix bug in FirstTime causing endless loop under some conditions

	* better completion for config variables and a new warning if an
	unregistered config variable is being set
