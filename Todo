	* force: I'd expect 'force ls' to always fetch fresh CHECKSUMS
	files. Currently it doesn't.

	* "ls dowens" fetches D/CHECKSUMS and D/DO/CHECKSUMS even if we already
	have D/DO/DOWENS/CHECKSUMS. Is this a bug? Is it worth fixing?

	* Bug: installing scripts without modules? How does it work? How
	should it work? getting the latest version ad-hoc?

	* Bug: checksum mismatch on a file is being reported even when the
	file has 0 bytes. 0 bytes should clearly constitute the right/the
	duty to overwrite.

	* Bug: what? we still do not support Build.PL? Didn't anybody send
	me a patch? Try 'install CPAN::Metadata::RDF' and see how this can
	be fixed as quickly as possible.

	Try:        look CPAN::Metadata::RDF
	then there: perl Build.PL;./Build;./Build install

	This does nothing for the prerequisites. We could lookup META.yml
	either then or beforehand.

	* Bug: "reload cpan" does not work if the old and the new CPAN.pm
	have a different path. I installed a new CPAN.pm from CPAN and it
	did remove the old /usr/share/perl/5.8/CPAN.pm but installed the
	new one as /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.7/CPAN.pm. The reload then
	always just said "0 subroutines redefined".

	* YAML for dependency checking in rev 268

	* bz2 support: testobject is ARTURAZ/Net-Vypress-Chat-0.72.1.tar.bz2
	DONE in rev 264

	* Todo: sha256 DONE in rev 263

	* Todo: 4th colmn in the 'r' command has not the canonical name
	but the unneeded D/DC/ stuff. DONE in rev 262.

	* Globbing on the ls command: completion? REJECTED

	* Feature request: if I type 'm CGI:Session' (note the missng second
	colon) I get

	No objects of type Module found for argument CGI:Session

	I believe, CPAN could supply the missing colon in this case. DONE

2005-11-30  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: when the Metadata file has been read with the old version and
	CPAN reads the new index it does not update the version. Witness
	Crypt::Khazad. Once the Metadata are removed completely and built up
	correctly, everything is OK.

	Can be tested by running

	!print $CPAN::META->{readonly}{"CPAN::Module"}{"Crypt::Khazad"}{"CPAN_VERSION"} = "1.0"
	reload index

	This may have nothing to do with multidot versions, just some
	pessimization in the code dealing with replacement of META when
	re-reading index files. FIXED

	* From: David Golden <david@hyperbolic.net>:

	> Also, "lack of distname support" is overblowing the situation.
	> Distnames are supported perfectly fine as long as you put it in the
	> proper syntax with author's ID and version.
	
	I think the problem Jim encountered is that "proper syntax" is part of
	the arcana of CPAN.  It's not obvious from the help:
	
	>  a,b,d,m  WORD or /REGEXP/  about authors, bundles, distributions, modules
	>  i        WORD or /REGEXP/  about anything of above
	>  r        NONE              reinstall recommendations
	>  ls       AUTHOR            about files in the author's directory
	
	Something that clarifies that AUTHOR/DIST-VERSION is a valid format
	would help.  Or rather, some specific example of what that WORD can be:
	
	  where WORD is either a module, bundle or author name or a
	  distribution name of the form AUTHOR/DISTRIBUTION-VERSION
	
	It's vaguely alluded to in the CPAN perldoc, but only in the section
	describing the four CPAN::* classes.
	
	A doc patch would be a quick fix for this.

	* globbing on the ls command: only ls 'GBARR/Scalar*', or even 'ls
	*/makepatch'? 2005-12-12: DONE 

	* script to copy relevant files to the perl tree. DONE

2005-11-04  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* is version in script/cpan OK? It was 1.3 in perl @25981! Same
	for Nox.pm FIXED

	* PAUSE key 2005? DONE

2005-11-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Need Releasenotes, the ChangeLog is a big mess with the numerous
	checkins that all were just testing the release cycle itself and
	not generating anything useful for the user. DONE

2005-11-02  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: why did the release only contain a ChangeLog up to release
	206 when we were at 212? Ah, I see, the disttest target does not
	make a to-be-released file, must be done by make dist. So the
	whole release was @206. No harm done because between 206 and 212 I
	only worked on the release target. I think I need a disttest of my
	own that takes the dist.tar.gz already built and tests it, not the
	one that builds a dist from the air again into the air and tests
	that. I want a real test of that file that is going to be
	released. Then I can live with 'make release' running both dist
	and disttest. I think. DONE
	
	* Bug: as a non-root user and first-time caller (no ~/.cpan/
	directory) I said "not ready for interactive configuration" and
	then said 'o conf init'. I got no questions asked but into a fast
	endless loop like so:

(1) Africa
(2) Asia
(3) Central America
(4) Europe
(5) North America
(6) Oceania
(7) South America
Select your continent (or several nearby continents) []

Sorry! since you don't have any existing picks, you must make a
geographic selection.

	until I hot ^C. *Very* Clever tricks with prompt?

	Reproducable as described. Leaving the shell and entering it again
	make it not reproducable. I must 'rm -rf ~/.cpan
	lib/CPAN/Config.pm' to reproduce. FIXED in rev 214

2005-10-21  Andreas J Koenig  <akoenig@cellular.de>

	* cpan> m Apache::AuthAny 
	Can't call method "upload_date" on an undefined value at /usr/perl-5.8.4/lib/5.8.4/CPAN.pm line 5761.

	FIXED in rev 186.

	* Slaven suggests a variable "permanently_connected" that helps to
	decide if a connection to the internet is available. Do ask the
	community if people care about such stuff. Slaven expects, some
	will care that the the 'm' and 'd' commands now make a connection
	to the internet. FIXED by introducing do_ls_on_m_and_d.

2005-10-20  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* ChangeLog needs to be written by svn during make dist, and the
	dependencies must care for a rerun of 'perl Makefile.PL' when
	CPAN.pm gets edited. This would be 'svn log -r HEAD:131' for the
	ChangeLog, I think. FIXED

2005-10-18  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: installing SWETH/IPv4.pm did not seem to work anymore.
	FIXED in revision 172.

	* Bug: there is a directory ZTANG/Text-PORE-102/ on CPAN with a
	single file README in it. ls chokes on ZTANG because of this. Is
	it a bug that the directory exists or is it a bug that it has no
	CHECKSUMS file? FIXED by simply removing the README file from
	CPAN.

2005-10-12  Andreas J Koenig  <akoenig@cellular.de>

	* Bug: the nonsense command 'force ls andk' should just do a plain
	'ls andk'. Instead it complains: C<Warning: Cannot ls andk, don't
	know what it is.> FIXED in rev. 180

2005-10-11  Andreas J Koenig  <akoenig@cellular.de>

	* Bug: "o conf foo bar" should complain about invalid key "foo".
	It does instead set "foo" to "bar" and it happened to me to set
	"debug" to "all" and then I wondered why debugging was not turned
	on. Would it have complained, I would have found the correct
	command ("o debug all") much quicker. FIXED in rev. 178.

	* Same effect can be illustrated by changing to the source's root
	directory, running 'perl -Ilib -MCPAN -e shell', 'install
	Tie::CPHash' (or something else???) and then 'reload cpan'....
	Ahhh, this latter example it is a matter of somebody having turned
	off $^W globally:-)...FIXED

	cpan script should accept arguments as suggested by Matt Sergeant:
	   cpan install My::Foo
	
	Cache manager should read youngest directories first and start
	deleting without measuring as soon as the cache limit is reached.
	
	Rename 'o conf' to 'set' and 'o debug' to 'set debug'.
	
	Profiling?
	
	Provide something, so that the next "o conf commit" will not overwrite
	the config file. maybe "myconfig_readonly"?
	
	I have a patch by Jochen Wiedmann that implements a per-distribution
	permanent configuration directory. The new containsmods() method in
	1.52 should help to fit the patch with the rest of CPAN.pm.
	
	Option to skip testing (Ask Bjoern Hansen).
	
	Default Argument for make,test,look,etc. could be the last argument???
	
	Make a preferred download method configurable (allow further download
	methods via plugin?)
	
	Allow different site preferences for index files and other files
	
	Replace make with Make
	
	Maintain the cache at runtime. Currently we only check it at startup.
	
	Distribute compressed CHECKSUM files
	
	Security layer
	
	make plugins configurable, adjust @ISA
	
	Make configurable that multiple additional index files can be
	integrated (for Intra-CPANs). I believe CPAN::Site did it right
	anyway, so we might skip this.
	
	Make the 'make' command itself configurable as suggested by Rujith de
	Silva <rujith.desilva@ps.net>, who wants to run 'sudo make install'
	instead of 'make install'. (Fixing this is delayed, because it
	interacts with Make.pm)
