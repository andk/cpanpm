  Math::BigInt without GMP takes loooooong to compute this test. I
  never reached an end because I usually give up after 30 minutes.
  Only if Math::BigInt::GMP is installed, this test is computed in a
  second. Last time verified with Crypt-DH-0.06 and Math::BigInt 1.88.

match:
  distribution: "^BTROTT/Crypt-DH-"
  perl: ".../installed-perls/..."
depends:
  requires:
    Math::BigInt::GMP: 1.23
