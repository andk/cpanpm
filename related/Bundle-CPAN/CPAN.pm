=head1 DESCRIPTION

This bundle includes CPAN.pm as the base module.

When CPAN installs this bundle it tries immediately to enable
Term::ReadLine so that you do not need to restart your CPAN session.

In this bundle Term::ReadLine::Perl is preferred over
Term::ReadLine::Gnu because there is no way to express I<OR> in
dependencies.

Note that all modules in this Bundle are not strict prerequisites to
get a working CPAN.pm. CPAN.pm can work quite well without the other
modules. The other modules are B<suggested> and can safely be
installed later.

Please install the Bundle::CPANxxl to get a few more.
